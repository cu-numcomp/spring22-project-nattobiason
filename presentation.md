# PyArmadillo
PyArmadillo is a python linear algebra library with the goal of mirroring matLab abilities and syntax. This library mirrors the original Armidillo C++ library (just now in python). 

## Why PyArmadillo
PyArmadillo is a general linear algebra library so that pyhon users can easily and simply do linear algebra calculations. 
Main benifits:
* Synax: If users are used to a MatLab like synax then this library will be easier to use than numpy (or something similar)
* Conversion to C++: Considering pythons reputation for being slow... the authors of PyArmadillo claim that the conversion from Python to C++ code is simple
* Free (compared to MatLab subscription fees)

## Stakeholders
This library is published in The Journal of Open Source Software

Authors: Jason Rumengan, Terry Yue Zhuo, Conrad Sanderson



## Metrics and Features 
Speed: claims speed improves when converting to C++
